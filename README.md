Some networking code, alpha status 0.2.1.

Started writing this many many moons ago and never got it working correctly untill a recent overhaul(2013).
After that, I added some cool stuff, like event registration, GnuTLS support, and websockets. It is a little strange due to it's C++ nature, and has not been seriously audited yet, but I believe it is pretty dang easy to use.  check out the test code for examples.  There are a few caveats with the message structure and decoding, see documentation for more details.
